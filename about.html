    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>GitHub.com 
    Development of the GitHub.com platform began on October 19, 2007.<br>
    The site was launched in April 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, P. J. <br>
    Hyett and Scott Chacon after it had been made available for a few months prior as a beta release.<br>
    GitHub has an annual keynote called GitHub Universe.<br>
    Organizational structure<br>
    GitHub, Inc. was originally a flat organization with no middle managers; in other words, "everyone is a manager" (self-management).<br>
    Employees could choose to work on projects that interested them (open allocation), but salaries were set by the chief executive.<br>
    In 2014, GitHub, Inc. introduced a layer of middle management amid harassment claims made against senior management.<br> 
    Tom Preston-Werner resigned as CEO amid the scandal.<br>
